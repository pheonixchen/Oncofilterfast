This is the github repository of R package Oncofilterfast
In cancer research, the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their association with patient survival outcomes is a critical step in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and treatment response. While numerous tools are available for assessing the impact of individual genes on patient survival outcomes in specific cancers, their analyses are typically limited to one gene at a time. These approaches falls short of addressing the need for high-throughput analysis. Oncofilterfast, an R package, bridges this gap by providing a novel method for the high-throughput screening of survival differential genes (SDGs) based on expression data and survival information. Utilizing the survival(1) and survminer(2) R packages, Oncofilterfast offers a streamlined approach to identify genes significantly associated with survival, enhancing the discovery of potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
